    content: "Howdy! My names is James Black. I’m based in Austin, Texas and I’m a Hip-Hop artist. I’ve been playing guitar since I was a kid, and have been in several bands in high school and college. I’ve been producing Hip-Hop and alternative music on Logic Pro and FL Studio since 2017. I enjoy different styles from many of my music idols such as Otis Redding, Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G., The Grateful Dead, Joey Bada$$, and James Taylor. I am an artist pioneering the Crypto/NFT and music scene. Step into my world, take a look at the rest of the website, and check out my socials to keep up with new music.
